Introduction
Music carries emotional depth. With Spotifys audio features dataset, we can explore how moods in music evolve over time and differ across genres. This analysis classifies songs into emotional categories (e.g., Happy, Sad, Party, etc.) using features like valence, energy, and danceability.

Dataset Overview
We use a cleaned and mood-tagged dataset created from spotify_songs.csv.

Mood Classification Logic
The moods are derived from Spotify’s audio features:

Happy: High valence and high energy

Sad: Low valence and low energy

Party: High valence and high danceability

Angry: Low valence and high energy

Chill: Low valence, low energy, and low danceability

Mixed: All others

Future ideas:

Include tempo and key for more emotional nuance

Compare across countries or artists

Build interactive dashboards (see Shiny app!)
